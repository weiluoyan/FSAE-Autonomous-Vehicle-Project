# FSAE-Autonomous-Vehicle-Project

üöÄ Formula SAE Autonomous Vehicle Development
üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) system for Formula SAE (FSAE) competitions using ROS, LiDAR, SLAM, and CARLA Simulator. The goal is to create a self-driving racing car capable of detecting cones, planning paths, and navigating the track autonomously.

üéØ Project Goals
	1.	Perception System: Implement LiDAR & Camera-based object detection for cone recognition.
	2.	Localization & Mapping: Develop SLAM using LiDAR and IMU data to build an accurate track map.
	3.	Path Planning & Control: Implement A / RRT* algorithms for autonomous navigation.
	4.	Simulation & Testing: Utilize CARLA and Gazebo for virtual testing before real-world implementation.
	5.	Hardware Integration: Deploy AV software on Hesai Pandar40 LiDAR and Jetson TX2.

 üì¶ Tech Stack & Dependencies
	‚Ä¢	Programming Languages: Python, C++
	‚Ä¢	Frameworks: ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
	‚Ä¢	Simulation Tools: CARLA, Gazebo
	‚Ä¢	Perception: OpenCV, PCL (Point Cloud Library)
	‚Ä¢	Algorithms: SLAM (Cartographer, LOAM), Path Planning (A*, RRT)
	‚Ä¢	Hardware: Hesai Pandar40 LiDAR, Jetson TX2
